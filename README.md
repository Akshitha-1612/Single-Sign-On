# Single-Sign-On(SSO)

A secure authentication system enabling users to access multiple applications with a single login. Features include multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control, robust session management, and strong security practices.

# Features
1.Single Sign-On: Seamless login to multiple applications with one set of credentials
2.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Optional MFA for enhanced security
3.Role-Based Access Control: Fine-grained authorization management
4.Session Management: Single logout (SLO), session timeout, and inactivity logout
5.Security: Encrypted communication, secure token storage (JWT), and protection against common threats

# Tech Stack
1.Frontend: React.js
2.Backend: Node.js, Express.js
3.Database: MongoDB
4.Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
5.Security: HTTPS, encryption standards

# Usage
1.Register a new user or log in using SSO.
2.Access multiple integrated applications without repeated logins.
3.Manage roles and permissions via the admin dashboard.
4.Experience secure session handling and automatic logout on inactivity.

# Security Highlights
1.All communication over HTTPS
2.JWT-based stateless authentication
3.Secure token storage and handling
4.Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF)

# Challenges Addressed
1.Secure token storage
2.Effective session timeout and management

# Future Enhancements
1.Audit Logging: Track authentication and authorization activities
2.Third-Party Identity Provider Integration: Google, Okta, etc.
3.Adaptive Authentication: Dynamic security based on risk assessment
